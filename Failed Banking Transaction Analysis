This project simulates a real-world data engineering pipeline for analyzing failed banking transactions. It involves ingesting large volumes of daily transaction data from multiple city branches, cleaning and transforming it using PySpark on Google Cloud Dataproc, and storing the results in Cloud SQL for analysis and visualization using BigQuery.
